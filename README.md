# YTLive chat WebSockets
This is intended to be a WebSocket server that integrates with YouTube livestream chat, with a simplified output for applications which have limited text parsing. This is originally designed for [NeosVR](https://neos.com).

## Download / Install
You can find the latest download on the [releases page](https://github.com/Lexevolution/yt-live-chat-ws/releases).

Run the executable from anywhere, will generate a `config.json` in the same folder as the executable, so it is recommended to put the executable in its own folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/Lexevolution/yt-live-chat-ws.git
```
